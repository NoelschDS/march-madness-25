# March Madness 25 Kaggle Competition
2 member team repository. I, Nick, am working with my long time friend and colleague Ghaith, to predict the march madness tournaments for both the men and women. We are employing feature engineering and model selection processes to develop the best model possible with limited time.

Our feature engineering consists of:
  -Counting regular season win totals for each time.
  -Calculating the average game score differential for each team.
  -Averaging a national ranking for each team (Men only).
  -Calculating average totals for each of: points, rebounds, steals, turnovers, assists, FG%, 3FG%, FT%, and fouls.

  We are currently training RandomForest classifiers from the SciKit Learn library. 

  Our current test set accuracy ranges from 60-80%.
